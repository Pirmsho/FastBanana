# FastBanana

[See The Project In Action](https://youtu.be/0yxgOzvJsmE)

FastBanana is a Fake Landing Page Built with **Next Js** **TypeScript** and **Framer-Motion**.

This Project, Unlike Other Ones, Focuses Mainly on Design And User Experience. As I'm Lacking in These Departments, I thought It Would Be A Good Idea to Practice It Using Next, TypeScript and Framer-Motion.
